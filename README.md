# Sketcherbook Pro

I made this project a few weeks after Windows 10 launched and planned to put it on the market.
An accident happened and I lost over 2 months worth of work, since then I haven't touched the project untill today, 31/07/2016. 
I have decided to add this project to GitHub in hopes that someone will learn something from the project.

Feel free to run the app and draw away! It's features include

* Managable layers with a lock
* Colour Picker
* Sharable sketches
* Editable ink canvas
